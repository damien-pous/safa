This OCaml library contains symbolic algorithms for checking language
equivalence or inclusion of automata with a large alphabet, using
symbolic representations (BDDs).

It is described in the following paper, in Proc. POPL'15
http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2676726.2677007
https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01021497v2/document

This library can be used to obtain symbolic algorithms for Kleene
algebra with tests (KAT), see library [symkat]

Compile the library by typing [make]

Here is a succinct description of each module:

sets 	  	   : sets of integers
hashcons	   : J.C. Filliâtre's hash-consing library
hset		   : J.C. Filliâtre's sets of hash-consed values
hmap		   : J.C. Filliâtre's maps indexed by hash-consed values
common		   : common definitions and utilities
queues		   : various queues (fifo, lifo, random)
stats		   : simple statistics collector
trace		   : recording traces of executions

bdd		   : (multi-terminal) binary decision diagrams

automata	   : types for the various kind of manipulated automata

determinisation	   : symbolic determinisation
epsilon		   : symbolic removal of epsilon-transitions

congruence	   : congruence closure algorithm
antichain	   : an antichain data-structure

safa		   : symbolic algorithms for language equivalence
