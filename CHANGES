version 1.5 (2016 june 21)
- [Common.Set.to/of_list] 
- [Bdd.iter] function
- antichain-based algorithm in [Safa]
- exported (private) type of [Bdd.node]

version 1.4 (2016 february 1)
- allow for custom output checks in equivalence algorithms
- added various Common.Set functions
- added cardinal function to Sets.T
- bug-fix in [Automata.SNFA.size]
- exported memoisation functions in Common
- new [Bdd.partial_apply] function
- [Stats.print] now sorts the entries

version 1.3 (2014 November 25)
- library split into
  . SAFA (Symbolic Algorithms for Finite Automata)
  . SymbolicKAT (Symbolic Algorithms for KAT, depends on SAFA)
- more polymorphism for BDDs and automata: the [key] and [var]
  types are no longer fixed
- cleaner and more complete interface to BDDs
- standalone size function on DFA


* in the versions below SAFA and SymbolicKAT were a single
  library called "symbolic_kat"

version 1.2 (2014 October 21)
- elimination of KAT hypotheses
- up to congruence version of the algorithms
- hashconsed symbolic KAT expressions (more efficient for Antimirov, but 
  much more memory demanding for Brzozowski)
- automata rendering in DOT format

version 1.1 (2014 October 7)
- nicer command line
- fixes about Gc management

version 1.0 (2014 July 11)
- first public release
